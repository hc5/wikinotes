				<h1 id="about-wikinotes">About WikiNotes</h1>
				<p>Wikinotes is a rapidly growing student group that strives to provide free and open student-generated course content through an easily editable wiki. Founded in September 2010 by McGill students and for McGill students, WikiNotes aims to have a comprehensive and high-quality set of course materials, available to the general public under an <a href="/about/licensing">open license</a>. We provide a wide variety of content, including lecture notes, solutions to past exams, student-written practice questions and course overviews, all of which is intended to function as a supplement to instructor-provided course materials and is moderated for quality. Integrating the collaborative power of the Internet with original material, WikiNotes provides an openly accessible and easy-to-use platform to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and resources among students.</p>
				<p>You can find out more about how WikiNotes began on our <a href="/about/history">history</a> page.
